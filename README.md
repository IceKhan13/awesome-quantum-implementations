Awesome Qiskit ![ecosystem](https://img.shields.io/badge/Qiskit-Ecosystem-blueviolet)
===============

Curated by community list of implementations of quantum algorithms, software packages and tools for Qiskit Ecosystem 

## Core ![ecosystem](https://img.shields.io/badge/Qiskit-Core-blueviolet)

|  Name | Description  | Tags  |
|---|---|---|
|  https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra | Qiskit is an open-source framework for working with noisy quantum computers at the level of pulses, circuits, and algorithms. <br>Qiskit is made up of elements that work together to enable quantum computing. This element is Terra and is the foundation on which the rest of Qiskit is built.  | ![core](https://img.shields.io/badge/core-1f425f.svg) ![core](https://img.shields.io/badge/pulse-1f425f.svg) ![core](https://img.shields.io/badge/circuit-1f425f.svg) |
|  https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-machine-learning | The Machine Learning package simply contains sample datasets at present. It has some classification algorithms such as QSVM and VQC (Variational Quantum Classifier), where this data can be used for experiments, and there is also QGAN (Quantum Generative Adversarial Network) algorithm.  | ![core](https://img.shields.io/badge/core-1f425f.svg) ![core](https://img.shields.io/badge/ML-1f425f.svg) ![core](https://img.shields.io/badge/VQC-1f425f.svg)   |

|https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer |Qiskit is made up of elements that each work together to enable quantum computing. This element is Aer, which provides high-performance quantum computing simulators with realistic noise models. | ![core](https://img.shields.io/badge/core-1f425f.svg) ![core](https://img.shields.io/badge/simulator-1f425f.svg) | 
|https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature |Qiskit Nature is an open-source framework that supports problems including ground state energy computations, excited states and dipole moments of molecule, both open and closed-shell. | ![core](https://img.shields.io/badge/core-1f425f.svg)  |
